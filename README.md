# API_PRODUCTS

API ABOUT AN ECOMMERCE PRODUCT CATALOG

## 2st Project of the 3rd Module (Back End) of the Blue EdTech Web Development course.

## Theme and Purpose:

<p>
The second project of the module consists of creating an API with a list to be consumed by the Front End, performing the 4 operations of CRUD, GET (ALL and by ID), POST, PUT and DELETE in MVC standards. As a continuation of the first project, only now, the objective is to persist the data in a database, and the chosen one was mongoDB, and also using mongoose, which is a Node.JS library that provides a schema-based solution for modeling your application data. The list created by me this time was a list of products from an online store, containing several products, such as shirts and sneakers, and also being able to add new products that you want, being any one, putting all the available details of them, editing the compounds in the list and delete them to your preference.
